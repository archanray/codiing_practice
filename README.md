## Introduction

I am generally keeping track of my coding practice in this repository.
Almost all codes are `medium` level problems in leetcode. 
I have strictly stuck with the free tier problems in LC and added some other
problems which I came across as I was practicing.

#### Required packages
* All codes written in `python3`. 
* Should be plug and play. If not try using libraries like `numpy`, or `re`. Although I have tried my best in avoiding any such libraries. 

This coding zoo avoids any deep learning based codes. For those please find one of my projects or some other repositories in my profile.
